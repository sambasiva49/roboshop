boto core and boto3 is ansible talk to aws
ansible inventory:ansible maintain some node that node information in file that file is called inventory
just create one ec2 machine it t3.micro for practice purpose
ater installation of ansible in the workstation there you need to create one file
vi /tmp/inv in this file you need to give private ip add of ec2
that node connect to ssh to do this
ansible -i /temp/inv all -e  ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ansible.builtin.ping
if you remove the cache rm -rf .ansible
if you want to install any module ansible.builtin.yum then you need to give arguments
ansible -i /temp/inv all -e  ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ansible.builtin.yum -a nginx it will go and install nginx
in the remote node and -a(arguments) and these are the commands called ad-hoc commands
if you have one or two nodes you don't write a file you simple give like  this command ansible -i privete ip adress with comma all
ex: ansible -i 172.31.42.51,172.31.42.52 all and above commands  even one node you need to give comma

if you want to pull the code one same machine first you need to install ansible on the server then
ansible-pull -i localhost, -U git hub repo 01-print.yml
