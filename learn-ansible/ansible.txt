that node connect to ssh to do this
ansible -i /temp/inv all -e  ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ansible.builtin.ping
if you remove the cache rm -rf .ansible
if you want to install any module ansible.builtin.yum then you need to give arguments
ansible -i /temp/inv all -e  ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ansible.builtin.yum -a nginx it will go and install nginx
in the remote node and -a(arguments) and these are the commands called ad-hoc commands
if you have one or two nodes you don't write a file you simple give like  this command ansible -i privete ip adress with comma all
ex: ansible -i 172.31.42.51,172.31.42.52 all and above commands  even one node you need to give comma
